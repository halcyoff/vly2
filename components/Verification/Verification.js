        <h1>Being a great volunteer </h1>
        <p>
            In order to support safety and trust in our community,
                    we have a code of conduct all volunteers need to follow in your heart. This
                    code sets out principles and behaviours that the Voluntarily community reasonably
                    expects of people participating in voluntarily activities.
        </p>
        <h3>Basic Principles</h3>
        <p>The community expects volunteers to:
          <ul>
            <li>Conduct themselves honestly and in good faith at all times. </li>
            <li>Comply with all laws, including sale of goods and intellectual property laws. </li>
            <li>Comply with Voluntariliyâ€™s terms and conditions.</li>
            <li>Accept the full Code of Conduct and Terms of Use</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </Modal>
